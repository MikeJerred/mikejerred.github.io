  "markdown": "I was hired on a 2 week contract to build a javascript library that replicated the functionality of the [segment.io analytics library](https://segment.com/docs/sources/), but modified to send all requests through a seperate service, which would cache requests that were sent whilst offline and send them later.\n\nI figured out what the library was doing by reading a combination of the documentation and source code, and I built the required tool as an npm package using Typescript, complete with unit tests and generated documentation."
