  "markdown": "This project was a redesign of an already existing site. The database already existed, but the website was to be completely remade. The same tools and methodology were used as in the [Lawyer Market Intelligence](/portfolio/1) project: AngularJs on the front-end with a C# Web API server. This site also used Apache Solr to index the database and provide a fast searching functionality.\n\n\nLink to the site: <http://fashionmonitor.com>"
