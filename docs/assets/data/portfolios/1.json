  "markdown": "This was a brand new project, aimed at providing information about law firms, companies and cases to lawyers. I was the lead developer and architect for this project, and decided to use AngularJs on the front-end with a C# Web API server and a SQL Server database.\n\nI started work on the project alone in order to build the foundations. I built the outline for the C# server and the AngularJs app, and built one module to retrieve data from the database and display it on the website. After this, the other developers joined in and we split the work into self-contained modules with one developer working on one module at a time. An example module might be to create a news ticker for the homepage, and so this would require working across the full stack building the database entities, business logic, API endpoints and front-end view. This allowed the project to be built rapidly by multiple developers in parallel, whilst also ensuring that every developer was working across the full stack and understood how each layer worked.\n\nWith this approach the project was completed comfortably within the deadline.\n\nLink to the site: <http://thelawyermarketintelligence.com>"
